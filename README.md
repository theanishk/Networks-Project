# Networks-Project

### This project was done in the course HSN-619 Networks at Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee

This study examines voting mechanisms in social networks, focusing on delegative (liquid) democracy, where votes are delegated to trusted neighbors. Inspired by Boldi et al. (2009), we simulate a proxy voting system on the DBLP co-authorship network, exploring how influence spreads across connections. By simulating three types of elections based on productivity and co-authorship strength, we analyze the impact of network structure and individual voting choices on outcomes.

Python is used as coding language to analyze the data.

Data was taken from [here](https://www.aminer.cn/citation).
